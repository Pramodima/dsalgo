/*
* In 1965, Vladimir Levenshtein defined the distance between two words as the
minimum number of "edits" it would take to transform the misspelled word into a
correct word, where a single edit is the insertion, deletion, or substitution of a single
character. For example, the Levenshtein distance between "Saturday" and "Sundays"
is 4 delete the first 'a' and 't', substitute V by 'n' and insert the trailing 's'.
â€”
Write a program that takes two strings and computes the minimum number of edits
needed to transform the first string into the second string.
